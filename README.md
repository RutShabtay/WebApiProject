# CareerVista ‚Äì Bridging Students and Employers

This project is an RL (Role-based Authorization) system designed to easily and efficiently connect employers and job seekers. This platform provides a set of endpoints for interacting with  job opportunities and job seekers, based on the authenticated user role.
Security is enforced via JWT-based authentication, with optional Google login for added convenience.
The system supports full CRUD functionality for both jobs and users, with strict access controls ensuring that each operation aligns with the user‚Äôs permissions.
